Now incorporated: quick&dirty integration of Solomon.

Note: to run as a solomon client, use the following command line:

java -jar dist/CS151_RPS.jar cs151_rps.CS151_RPS --p1 AI --p2 remote --level smart -r 128

This forces the computer (AI) to go first.  And Solomon is integrated into a new player type (remote) rather than a new io type.  It is not integrated to work with the passive controller (i.e., the GUI locus of control).
