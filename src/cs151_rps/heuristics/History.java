/**
 * Implements storage and retrieval of a history of prior gestures 
 * in the game.  As rounds are played, the gestures are given to this class 
 * (addRound()), and may be retrieved up to a predetermined level 
 * (getLastMoves()).
 *
 * The sole purpose of this history is to feed the Analysis class for heuristic 
 * prediction of the human player.  This only requires keeping a fixed number of 
 * previous gestures, rather than the complete history of gestures.
 * 
 * This is a singleton class which creates a single instance of one of its  
 * subclasses via a factory.  The first instantiation designates which subclass 
 * to create; any subsequent requests for instantiation return the same 
 * subclass (same object), no matter what subclass was requested.
